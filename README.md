# Repo Backup

This program clones all your repositories into a backup folder, making it easy to back up your GitHub repositories.

> Note: Only public repositories are supported. The program will only clone up to 30 repositories. If you have fewer than 30, there won't be any issues.

## How to Use

- Run `backup.py` to back up your repositories.
- To reconfigure, delete `config.json` and run the program again.
